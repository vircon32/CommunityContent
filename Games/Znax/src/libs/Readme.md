# Vircon32 Libraries
--------------------

This folder includes additional libraries that you can use in Vircon32 programs, in addition to the standard headers that are part of the C compiler.

Each of them will be a single, separate file that you can include in your projects. Still, watch for possible dependencies between them!

Each library also includes a small example program to serve as example to show how to use the library functions.
