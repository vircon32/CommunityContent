## Vircon32 Game Features / changes:
- High score saving and loading from the memory card
- Optimized Game time, games take less time than in original gp2x game
- Relative Timer game mode tweaks, you gain less time for clearing blocks compared to original gp2x game, this prevents endless games
- Removed Skin support compared to original gp2x game

## Playing the Game:
You as the player need to select 4 blocks of the same color of the corners of rectangles as big as you can. By doing so you will erase all blocks in this rectangle and they will be replaced by new blocks. You keep on doing this untill the time runs out, and try to gain your highest score possible. 

## Game Modes:
There are two game modes, Relative Timer and Fixed Timer.

### Fixed Timer:
In this mode you don't get extra time for deleting blocks but just points added to your score so here you try to get the highest amount of points in the given time period.

### Relative Timer:
In this mode you will gain extra time for deleting blocks and points added, you try to keep gaining time so you can play longer and gain higher scores.
